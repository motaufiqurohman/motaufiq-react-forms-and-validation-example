# React Forms and Validation Example

## Description

This project is a simple example of form handling and validation in React using regular state management (no form libraries like React Hook Form). Validation is handled using `Yup`, and styling is done with `Tailwind CSS`. The project also utilizes utility libraries such as `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, and `tailwind-variants` for cleaner and more maintainable styling.

It serves as a lightweight boilerplate or reference for building React forms with modern validation and styling practices.
